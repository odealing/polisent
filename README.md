### Prerequisites
Before getting started, you'll need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- pip

### Step 1: Clone the Project
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. Then, run the following command to clone the project:
```
git clone <repository-url>
```
Replace <repository-url> with the URL of the project's repository.

### Step 2: Install Required Packages
